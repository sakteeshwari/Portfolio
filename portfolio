 This portfolio website structure consists of an index.html file, a contact.html file, and a styles.css file.

Index.html:

It serves as the main page of your portfolio.
Includes a header with a navigation bar linking to the Home (index.html) and Contact (contact.html) pages.
The main section contains an "About Me" section with introductory content and a "Projects" section showcasing project information.
A footer is added at the bottom of the page with a copyright notice.

Contact.html:

It's the contact page where visitors can reach out to you.
Similar to the index page, it has a header with navigation.
The main section includes a "Get in Touch" section with a simple form for name, email, and message submission.
Also includes a footer.

Styles.css:

Contains basic styling for the entire website.
Resets default margin and padding for consistency.
Defines styles for headers, navigation, main content, forms, and the footer.
Provides a clean and consistent visual appearance for elements across both HTML pages.
You can further develop these files by:

Adding more content to the About Me section like your skills, experiences, etc.
Enhancing the Projects section by including images, links, or more detailed descriptions of your projects.
Styling the forms to make them more visually appealing or adding JavaScript for form validation.
Customizing the CSS to match your preferred color scheme, fonts, and layout.
Feel free to expand upon this structure and customize it to create a unique and compelling portfolio website.
